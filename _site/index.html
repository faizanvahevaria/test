      <h1><a href="/Last-Minute-NCLEX-Tips/">These Tips Will Help You Pass the NCLEX Even if it's Last Minute</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Finishing nursing school is quite the accomplishment, but passing the NCLEX is an even more daunting task that stands in between graduation and becoming a registered nurse.

Many students even take a prep course while finishing nursing school.  Regardless of how much prep work and studying you’ve already done for the test, there are always a few more things you can squeeze in last minute to boost your chances of passing.
The first few, and possibly the most obvious pointers for last-minute NCLEX prep do, of course, involve making sure that you are physically and mentally prepared to take a difficult exam.</p>
